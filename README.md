# Todolist React app

##Features 

- Fetch and show todo items from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

- Add a todo item, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the item in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add items to the 
  server. But the request is valid and will send you some data).

- Update the item, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).

- Delete an item, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call)
